Hey UChicago, do you want to go to Fogo de Chao? It's a gourmet Brazilian steakhouse located downtown. On Monday, May 25 (Memorial Day) there's going to be a HARC funded trip to Fogo where you can, for two hours, have all-you-can-eat beef as well as a HUGE and very well-stocked salad bar. If this sounds really interesting and delicious to you, you're in luck. We still have a few spots left on our trip, so if you're interested in going, don't hesitate to message me or email me at dmeagher@uchicago.edu. Thanks everyone!

duck on ellis across from ratner. Its been sitting there for a while despite its proximity to the cars and people walking by... Is that normal? edit: haha, okay, sorry, i didn't mean like it was just chilling there because i know we get quite a number those ducks in the area. its feathers keep flying around from the wind (including the underside feathers, dunno what they're called), and when i approached it, it only moved one of its legs and let the other one splay out. it didn't stand up. its eyes are also half-closed/closed. i literally know nothing about ducks, so i could totally be overreacting, and it's a very brave duck who doesn't give a fuck about my advances but wanted to throw this info out there in case someone actually does know something about ducks. hopefully it's fine, and this is just a cute pic of a duck.

Overseen in Ratner Update: baby did get up and get back into stroller
Email that all macleaners just got from Norman Maclean, the (deceased) namesake of our beloved dorm: No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I’ve been living in this elevator for what, like, over 20 years now? And, as a ghost, I’ve seen some shit. But I’m pretty sure this is the worst news I’ve gotten since I heard the Pulitzer committee passed up A River Runs Through It and Other Stories for nobody at all. Seriously, though. Maybe we can’t change the fact that Campus North is being built. But we can and should push back against the administration (if you feel so inclined) who are, at bare minimum, being somewhat careless about how the students feel (if not disregarding it completely), or mourn the communities, here and elsewhere on campus, that we risk losing. Will Campus North have singles that are available to first years? Three massive common areas? Janky-ass sofas? The freedom to paint stupid quotes on the walls? (I happen to like the Admiral Ackbar portrait that currently adorns my wall.) A war room? A psych ward? A murder bathroom? A massive, constantly dirty kitchen? A complete lack of odd-numbered rooms? Carpets that are constantly thirsty? No. Disregard the corporeal for a moment, though, as I’ve been doing since 1990, and consider that Maclean is more than old furniture and a building that used to be called the Church Home for Aged Persons. “Maclean,” as I see it, is in large part the multitude of invisible bonds that form between the hundreds of students that have lived at 5445 S. Ingleside for over two decades, a giant tight-knit network of people who were brought together by Housing and (probably) never in a million years would’ve made that many friends in college on their own steam. Those bonds wouldn’t exist were it not for the simple fact that this collection of students all lived in the same building at one point and thinks of itself as a group, a single entity with in-jokes and continuity and a really awesome name. You could call it “house culture.” I call it maybe one of the most worthwhile things UChicago does for its students. As you might’ve guessed, I’m dead. But hell, I’m also a writer, and therefore somewhat immortal. Here’s another way my spirit lives on (at least, nominally): through you, current residents, expats, and alums, and the relationships you’ve formed with each other. If Maclean—the name, building, or culture—goes, then I go too. Please don’t let them take that away. Norman F. Maclean William Rainey Harper Professor of English University of Chicago nmaclean@uchicago.edu P.S. I’ve communed with at least one alum who’s not donating money to the University anymore. Edit: Members of some of the houses that may (I refuse to say will) close are working on a petition to boycott donations to the university after our graduations if the university does not, at the very minimum, allow us to keep the names of our houses. Even if you are not from Maclean, Broadview, Breckinridge, or Blackstone, but you feel sorry for us, please contact Mike Dewar for information regarding the petition. Here's the facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/364260937104298/ Update: They are visiting the houses for what basically amounts to an FAQ, and they apparently admitted at the Breckinridge meeting that the name change is financially motivated. Please, get to that petition and promise never to donate to this school when you graduate unless they let us keep the names.

Lately I was wondering if the Botany Pond goldfish survive through the winter. I called Richard Bumstead of the campus Environment department, and he sent me an email including the below information. (He gave me permission to share the text, don't worry.) I just thought everyone else might like to know how the pond is managed, and that the goldfish mostly do just fine! The goldfish in Botany Pond are a self sustaining population, descendants from goldfish that have lived there for decades. In some winters we have major die back (as we did over the winter of 2013-14) but they do actively breed in the pond and the fish you see this spring are their offspring. We do not purchase new goldfish each year. In the summer, the Grounds Crew digs pits in the muck at the bottom of the pond for the fish to hibernate over winter below the frost line, along with the turtle population. I was happy to see a good population this spring emerge from the hibernation, with minimal loss. Years ago, the pond was drained each fall, and the fish were captured and held in aquariums until spring. A much less appealing existence. When we renovated the pond and sealed the liner we were able to leave the fish in the pond year-round.

Not overheard at UChicago: the sound of wind through Palm trees, Caribbean waves lapping the shore, live Reggae Salsa fusion... Had enough of the Chiberia weather? Why not spend your summer in paradise while completing your own ethnographic research project? The Isla Mujeres Ethnographic Field School offers 3 and 6 week Methods Sessions on this lovely island located in the Mexican Caribbean. The programs include archeological excursions to the world renowned Maya ruins Ek Balam and Chichen Itza, Cenote Swims, Spanish Language Bootcamp, Whale Shark and Sea Turtle tours, and PADI Scuba Diving excursions. Choose your own research topic to explore; past projects include Medical Anthropology (HIV prevention, Dengue Fever prevention, Teen Pregnancy, Alcoholism), Environmental Anthropology (Whale Shark Conservation, Sea Turtle Conservation), and various other subdisciplines (gender and identity, maya and catholic religions, economic development and tourism). Several students (including myself) from last summer's sessions were accepted to present at the 2015 Society for Applied Anthropology Conference and are working on publications. Not only is The Field School an amazing experience academically, but a genuinely awesome life experience. Take a break from the stresses of city life and build your CV while living on one of the most beautiful, welcoming Caribbean islands in the world. If it's any worth, this place is so amazing that I took a year off to live here hahah. Feel free to hit me up with any questions whatsoever, and I hope to see you on the beach!

Can we have a quick thread devoted to the pointlessness of meal exchanges. Honestly, I feel like it only serves as another way for the university to take money from us, and there is no benefit at all over flex (or maroon or whatever) dollars. The meal exchange options are rarely clear, change all the time (midway mart just changed their options in the last week, with no signs or warnings of any kind), and some cafes such as Logan have no meal exchange options at all. It becomes a struggle to find ways to use 3 meal exchanges a quarter so that they're not totally worthless. Additionally, it's difficult to know how many you have left, and I didn't even know they existed for most of first year.

Hey guys, I think you might want to hear this: If you use UChicago Crushes or UChicago Secrets, there’s a chance the people who run the page could be recording who submits which posts! Anonymonkey, the submission service used by *both* UChicago Crushes and Secrets, isn't so anonymous as it turns out. They recently changed their submission system so that every time you submit a post, it gives them your facebook user id along with an access token for your Facebook account. They could be storing these IDs, or worse, selling them! I was just looking through their source code, and look at this bit right here. What this line of code means is that they’re being delivered the plaintext user ID and token of everyone who submits a secret or crush. They now know who submits every post, and who knows what they could do be doing with it! Don't submit anything unless you want to risk being linked back to it later!

Sorry to spam the group, but I wanted to make sure the word got out about next month's local election. The deadline to register to vote for the Feb. 24 election is TOMORROW (Tuesday, Jan. 27). I urge all of you who are eligible (i.e., 18+ US citizens) to register: you can register (or check to see if you're already registered) online at http://www.chicagoelections.com/en/register-to-vote-change-of-address.html . These elections only happen once every four years, and your vote could have very important ramifications for future generations of students. Because of the decennial redistricting, many of you now live in the 5th Ward, which means there's a decent chance of ousting incumbent 5th Ward Alderman Leslie Hairston, who has been an opponent of progress and development in the neighborhood for 16 years. To learn more, you can check out an open letter I wrote about this race (https://letthemidwaybloom.wordpress.com/2014/11/04/an-open-letter-to-the-chicago-maroon-editorial-board/) and the website of Hairston's opponent, Anne Marie Miles (http://www.annemariemiles.com/). But the most important thing is to register to vote right now!

To all members of the UChicago community, My name is Daniel Glass and I am the student depicted in the widely-circulated salad-bar sneezing photo. First and foremost, I would like to genuinely apologize to anyone who was hurt, offended, or felt sick after eating at the salad bar on that fateful day. My actions during that fourth meal were seriously inconsiderate and I am deeply sorry to have caused pain to fellow members of my community. The photograph was insensitive and displayed poor sanitary decisions – something that I have realized, especially in light of recent events, to be extremely dangerous and harmful. Although it was not my intention to hurt anyone at this university, I regret to say that I already have, and I will take full responsibility for the food poisoning that I have caused. I would also like to apologize to all members of the college community – students, staff, and alumni – for intensifying the amount of food related posts on Overheard. I became aware of the seriousness of the photograph and of my mentality as the weeks passed by. Before I thought, “What’s the big deal, everybody sneezes?” But as the days went on and the amount of anti-sneeze rhetoric reached a zenith on Yik Yak I knew I had made a mistake. No longer will I gracelessly reach for a hard-boiled egg as my nose begins to tingle with the ominous feeling of a coming sneeze. I hope now, after watching Arley D Cathey’s “How to Eat at my Dining Hall” instructional video I will be able to spread the word about hygienic eating rather than spread disease like I’ve done in the past. So while I cannot empathize with all of those who have gotten sick due to my desire for double blue cheese on my cobb salad, I will do the most that I can: to remain educated on what is the proper amount of time to spend applying vinaigrette to my salads. Thank you for your time, Daniel Glass (Parody Above^)

To all members of the UChicago community, My name is Matt Jeong and I am the Asian student depicted in the widely-circulated Halloween photograph. First and foremost, I would like to genuinely apologize to anyone who was hurt, offended, or felt culturally or racially discriminated against as a result of my actions. My actions on the night of Halloween were seriously inconsiderate and I am deeply sorry to have caused pain to fellow members of my community. The photograph was insensitive and perpetuated racial stereotypes – something that I have realized, especially in light of recent events, to be extremely dangerous and harmful. Although it was not my intention to hurt anyone at this university, I regret to say that I already have, and I will take full responsibility for the emotional pain that I have caused. I would also like to apologize to all members of the college community – students, staff, and alumni – for intensifying the racial climate over the past few weeks and heightening the racial tension that the university had already been experiencing. I became aware of the seriousness of the photograph and of my mentality as the weeks passed by, and am grateful for having learned a valuable lesson about racial stereotyping. I understand that the use of the photograph was necessary to bring attention to a greater problem afflicting the university, and even though my participation in the movement to highlight racial inequality and intolerance in the university was previously involuntary and on the side of the aggressor, I hope now, after learning much about the racial climate present here, to be able to voluntarily and actively participate in bringing attention to micro-aggression at this university. Furthermore, I hope that recent campus events will not impede the movement for greater racial equality and tolerance on this campus. I have become much more sensitive to these racial issues as a result of recent incidents and I think that I have fulfilled that which I believe to be the motive of the movement: to educate and progress. Of course, although I may never understand the daily prejudices and micro-aggressions that Hispanics and blacks experience and suffer, I will do the most that I can: to remain educated in racial issues and to stand with them in solidarity. Yes, my actions were racist. Yes, I made some stupid and inconsiderate decisions on the night of Halloween. And yes, I have seriously hurt some of the members of the community to which I belong. But no, that is no longer the person I am and I deeply regret my actions and sincerely plead for the forgiveness of the members of my community. I understand that this forgiveness may not come easily or immediately, but I hope that my future actions will be able to somehow compensate for my past ones. Thank you for your time, Matt Jeong

So this sentence is translated as I didn't see you but the speaker intentionally decided not to look at them -- as in the speaker gave them the 'Hyde Park glance.' The Hyde Park Glance? Like when someone is on the quad and notices they're walking towards someone else, so they have to strategically look at a tree or building or something so they don't make eye contact. I know I definitely used this tactic occasionally when I lived in Hyde Park, and it seems it's still in use by the students today.

Please do not take this down. Please do not comment on this. I am posting this solely to spread information I recently received to the greatest number of University of Chicago people possible. That's all. I called the bias response team last night about the hacked post, and received a return call today. This is what I was told. - A campus and student life investigation has been started regarding this - They will put in every resources they can into trying to find the posters. - Members of the Bias Response Team are happy to meet with people about what has happened, to talk, and to listen. You can call or email them. - The office of multicultural student affairs, the bias response team, campus and student life, deans, and other groups are all working together with open communication on this - The woman I talked to said they absolutely will not tolerate this, that it is unacceptable. - Derek Caquelin and Vincente SubVersive Perez (or people who know them, since I'm not sure either of them is actually still using Facebook at this point) - she strongly urged you to contact the UChicago Police about this if you have not already done so. The police need your permission in order to thoroughly investigate the hacking, and they need your statements so that if these guys are caught, charges can be filed against them. - If you feel unsafe on campus: call the dean on call, go in to talk to the dean on call, or (for specific dangerous situations causing you to feel unsafe, rather than just general fear caused by this post) contact the UChicago police - Jeremy Inabinet, the Dean of Students in the University for Disciplinary Affairs, is aware of all this and is also involved in the investigation and talks about this. The threat recently made is absolutely enough reason for the students behind it to get expelled, the lady I talked to said. - All calls and emails to the Bias Response Team are being documented. The more they can document this stuff, the more than build up proof of a history of discrimination here That's all I can remember. Like I said, please do not comment. This is just to share some information.

From 'Sincerely, Petrified', by Anna Tambour, in the anthology Lovecraft Unbound: a tale about two UChicago professors. 'Professor Wilder taught psychiatry at the University of Chicago. Dr. Krey, a geologist with a huge reputation for his work on cryptobiotic soils, was a lecturer at U of C's School of Geophysical Sciences. In a campus famed for eccentric dressers, Wilder, an over-ripe-pear-shaped man, wore string ties: leather plaited thinner than a whipsnake, caught with a decorative silver choke. He had a collection of them and seemed to wear them according to some presentiment of what mood the day would bring. ... He didn't look any sillier in his string ties than Theo Grossner (Dean of the School), who wore sandals and socks throughout Chicago's winter.' (p. 46)

Overseen on the Economics Internship Listhost, somewhat suspiciously: [economics-internships] FW: Free Fossil Fuel Book For UChicago Professors Hello Professor Wong, On November 13, Penguin will publish The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, a new perspective on both the benefits and risks of coal, oil, and natural gas by Alex Epstein, founder of the Center for Industrial Progress. Now through October 31, Alex Epstein is offering a free hardcover copy of the The Moral Case For Fossil Fuels to professors and students. The shipping is also free. All you need to do is fill out this form and we'll send you a free book in the mail. “With more politicians in climate science than scientists, the refining fire of debate has devolved into the burning of heretics. Alex Epstein’s The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels may make your blood boil, but his cool reason and cold, hard facts will lead us beyond hysterics to a much better future.” —PETER THIEL, cofounder of PayPal and lead investor in Facebook. “Alex Epstein has written an eloquent and powerful argument for using fossil fuels on moral grounds alone. A remarkable book.” —MATT RIDLEY, author of The Rational Optimist You may also request copies for your classroom here. If you have any students or colleagues who might be interested in a free copy of the book, feel free to send them to FossilFuels.co. Thank you. ---Adam Edmonsond The Center for Industrial Progress

Overheard: Kissinger said any resulting referendum would be non-binding. 'Ultimately this makes no amendment to our governing document and so therefore just has no enforcement power,' he said. Kissinger went on to say that his slate would certainly consider the results when making their decision, though he is unsure whether the petition itself was legal as it was done online, whereas the SG Constitution says all petitions must be in print form. The copy available on its website does not specify that petitions must be in print. Kissinger said that the Student Assembly does not have authority on whether or not the new positions should be funded. 'I would argue that Assembly as a whole doesn’t have the authority to change how the administrative budget is allocated because it is managed by the Executive Committee, and that is the precedent that has been set up for years,' he said.

They ask for your latest gas and electric bill, and claim that they're fine with whatever utility suppliers you use, although they need to update today or they'll go away. WATCH OUT.

Hi everyone! Several RSO websites have recently been hacked in retaliation to the Hyde Park List. If you are an RSO leader and notice that your website has been hacked, I recommend that you (1) Contact the Dean of Students (jlellison@uchicago.edu) and notify him that your website has been hacked.

UCHICAGO MARKETPLACE SCAM When using UChicago marketplace, watch out for a scam for a woman buying electronics. A woman emails you saying she will pay for your electronics as a birthday present for her daughter. Then she says she has sent you a payment on PayPal for it, and wants you to ship it to Nigeria. The email used was monjones22@gmail.com, she said her name was Monica Jones. English was terrible but not scam-level bad, and she wanted to buy the phone. I didn't realize it was a scam until she said she sent the payment over PayPal when I had not yet set up an account...I obviously had not mailed her the smartphone yet (I'm not stupid) and she said to check my spam folder. Sure enough, when I checked my spam folder, there were emails from PayPal saying she sent me $$, but they were from a janky email address.

There was a young guy in the quad today asking me what time Paul Sally's class was. I was very confused about what he meant, so I just said I don't know.

Richard Posner, U of C law professor and judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, strikes down Indiana's and Wisconsin's ban on same-sex marriage: In other words, Indiana's government thinks that straight couples tend to be sexually irresponsible, producing unwanted children by the carload, and so must be pressured (in the form of governmental encouragement of marriage through a combination of sticks and carrots) to marry, but that gay couples, unable as they are to produce children wanted or unwanted, are model parents- model citizens really- so have no need for marriage. Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry. Go figure. http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2014/D09-04/C:14-2386:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1412336:S:0

Highlights from a conversation in Reynolds Club between two students/colleagues talking about issues with learning [physical] science: 1. See, your problem is, you keep thinking you gained something from primary and secondary school science classes, but you didn't because those people didn't know anything. 2. Speaking of a professor: How can you be tenured in Physics when you don't know anything about (technical terms) I think maybe he just has Alzheimer's. 3. (after discussing measurements) Well, that's the lesson from Einstein. You can't understand any medium unless you understand how it is measured. I think I know what time is because I think I know how a clock functions. 4. Yeah, I think his (some academic) conclusions about quantum-mechanics are correct, but his theoretical references are misleading. I think he relies on people not checking his references.

Overseen at the Pride Parade: UChicago Repin'
The University of Chicago has sent a postcard with this on it to my little brother “Here at UChicago, we like Sweden about as much as everybody else. Sure, we read the Dragon Tattoo books. We get over to the IKEA in nearby Schaumburg every now and then. We like ABBA, and Robyn, and The Knife, although we never got into that Gothenburg death metal. (Make us a mix - we could give it another try.) And to be totally honest with you, we fell asleep during Bergman’s The Seventh Seal. But there’s one thing we love importing from Sweden: Nobel Prizes.We’ve brought home 87 of them so far. We’ve won them in all six categories - Chemistry, Economics, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine. And we have eight Nobel laureates currently on our faculty. So pass the gravlax, grab a couple of kåldomar, and raise a glass of blåbärssoppa: Skol, Sweden! Thanks for the medals.“

St. Thomas the Apostle has over 30 pieces of original art listed with the National Art Inventories of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

It's called Galileo Galilei: Science, Art & Literature, listed as HIPS 29610, HIST 25013, or ITAL 29610. Anyone who enjoys history and science should take it. It's an awesome subject, and Daniele is an awesome guy. He'll be a great teacher, he's unbelievably friendly and helpful, and if you're really interested he just might invite you back to I-House at some point for some hands-on Italian culture (read: delicious, delicious food). So ya. Help keep good people employed.

Overheard in Tom Wood's Sosc class: Are you from one of the states that smells? It's tough [to randomly assign people to be married]. But with enough funds, anything is possible. Who gives a fuck? Married couples have sex or they don't, who the hell cares. Certain low people don't understand how to disembark a boat. These 3rd class douches forced their way off the boat. [About the Titanic] “Obviously my daughter is going to develop some sort of neurological illness because I bought her a cat toy.” “I’m always wondering why people don’t treat adding files to dropbox as I’m presenting as an opportunity for comedy. You could name files like ‘Why does the lecturer always come to class drunk.’… It would be lolz.” “I don’t want to encourage this academic impulse, but you’re now qualified to shit on other people’s work... You are well placed to ruin people's lives. [Student gets up to leave] “No, don’t leave! There’s still hope!… Oh, well, he can become a painter or something. Maybe it’s for the best.” This is way too important for some douchebag grad student to rule on. Everything we did in the final lab is just arming you to hurt people in the spring.

The Chicago Police breaks up a group of 100+ predominantly African American high school students who were gathered around the Point earlier this evening around 21:35. As the police officers were herding the youth to move west on 53rd street, violence erupted on the corner of 53rd and Dorchester around 21:50 when a police officer used force on a person and pinned him down onto the floor. According to the various police officers I talked to, the police said that there were too many students at one time, and these students were allegedly as a group drinking and doing drugs around a bonfire out at the lakefront. According to Ashley, a 15 year old, she and her group of five girl friends were hearing about this bonfire that was trending on Facebook and Twitter since last week. When they seem like they're up to no good, then, these kids present an image, said Joshua Mahlum, who is from the South Side. Then Hyde Park is not going to get a good image. Cops are gonna have to get more stricter. However, Mahlum observed that most of these students don't come from a rough background, and even if they cause havoc, they're just posin'. They're not bad kids. It's just too many at one time, one police officer commented.

Overseen next to the lab school: Safety getting lost.
Overseen on a graduate student's Facebook page: SCAV bothers me. I'm fine with nerds having fun in an overindulgent nerdfest. What really bothers me is the amount of importance this university puts on such a meaningless endeavor. People pretend like this is some celebration of creativity and intellectual originality. No. Wake up. You are not doing anything more significant than those weird geeks with Japanese fetishes who show up at anime conventions in droves having paid hundreds of dollars to create the most accurate Chun Li costume. When you are at a rich private school that gentrified an entire community of low-income African Americans and eradicated an entire culture of jazz and arts under the name of urban renewal, when that school is currently celebrating a swanky new art center that purports to engage a variety of cultures while cutting its trauma program so that all the gunshot victims in the South Side die on the ambulance ride to Northwestern, you have an obligation to do something meaningful and relevant. UChicago not only is an Ivory Tower and a sheltered and privileged bubble; it celebrates being one. There is a reason this school has so many Nobel laureates and yet very little social relevance. You want to do something creative? While I was at Harvard I saw student-produced theater that had incredible depth, social relevance and insight, and thoughtful creativity. Your student performances at Logan fall far short of that standard. Start there. Instead of bashing Harvard students for not being intellectual enough, why don't you realize that you need some proper training from real performing artists, people who understand humanity with more breadth and nuance? You want to do something intellectual? Why not start some conversations about our real world, instead of indulging yourselves in weird abstract geekery that has zero social impact? You bash Harvard for having grade inflation, and you think your Core is oh-so-profound because everyone has to read works by Durkheim, but the average quality of talks, panels, and classroom discussions I've seen here is far lower than that at Harvard, intellectually as well as in social relevance. The real world doesn't exist in an abstraction. The real world is complicated and doesn't quite fit neatly into intellectual arguments, broad or specific. Producing t-shirts that ask That's all well and good in practice, but how does it work in theory? is not helpful. So I guess the real reason SCAV bothers me so much is that it's emblematic of the whole self-indulgent, self-congratulating University of Chicago culture that is completely unaware of its privilege and so detached from reality. You have been given such blessings and resources that many students around the world can only dream of having. There are so many talented teenagers I have met working with under-resourced school districts that would probably look at your scavenger hunt and see the same thing we see when we look at Wall St -- an immense waste of talent and money. When I host Harvard information sessions, I often talk about the kind of holistic growth that is possible only because you are surrounded by talented individuals and Harvard will give them the resources to do cool stuff -- student research, projects at international NGOs, student activism, student performing arts, student debates, etc etc. A few months ago, an elderly tired-looking woman raised her hand and asked me why I was talking about students having fun and wasting time instead of focusing on academics. I told her that the level of academics at Harvard is top-notch, but academics is just a given -- it's a baseline on which we build more multifaceted, impactful things. I told her it's not a waste of time, because think about it: if we want to solve the massive incarceration problem in the U.S., do you want your policies designed by a social scientist who assiduously studied the problem on paper, or do you want someone who did study the theory but also went to volunteer at a prison rehabilitation program? I cannot say the same thing about the University of Chicago; we do in fact waste ridiculous amounts of time and resources doing crap like SCAV and meaningless academic discussions that don't involve real applicable solutions to real world problems. I told the lady that if you want to solely focus on academics, you should go to the University of Chicago. People criticize Harvard for graduating so many bankers, traders, and consultants. But I've seen a surprising number of people use those starting jobs as opportunities to learn more about the private sector so that they can create their own companies or do more impactful stuff in the public or non-profit sectors, and statistics from surveys on Harvard alumni back me up. There is a reason Harvard graduates so many CEOs, leaders, and politicians; and it is not just because of pedigree and exclusive elite circles. I am not saying Harvard graduates are altruistic world-changers. They are self-aggrandizing people who seek personal glory and bullshit about visions while comfortably residing in their privileged sheltered worlds. But at least they have those visions. At least they want to make some sort of impact, and at least they pretend to care about our larger society while pursuing their own successes. When have nerds ever changed our society (outside of the natural sciences) by purely focusing on abstract academic problems? For all the transformative theories that the social scientists at UChicago have come up with, why does this school have far less policy impact than Harvard does? How many new disruptive innovative companies or social projects do we ever see coming out of UChicago? This place has talent and resources. Why are we wasting them on SCAV when we can use that time to do much more meaningful things? Why are we ignoring our social responsibility?

Because a heptagon is not a constructible polygon, since an n-sided polygon is only constructible if the odd prime factors of n are distinct fermat primes, and seven is not a fermat prime? So it must have been extraordinarily difficult and expensive to draft and construct a gigantic castle with seven-sided everything? Good. That's what I think about when I watch Game of Thrones, too.

He ran three times, and the third time he got just under 60,000 votes which is really something.

An anecdote about a smart-aleck (read: that kid) from a 1982 paper by the late UofC professor Jim McCawley: Anyone who has taught an introductory syntax course has had the experience of presenting an ungrammatical example only to be told by some smart-aleck about an unsuspecting interpretation on which the sentence is quite normal. For example, in discussing the order of auxiliary verbs in English I have presented pairs of sentences such as (1)-(2) to illustrated that auxiliary 'have' must precede progressive 'be': (1) Tom has been smoking pot. (2) *Tom is having smoked pot. On one occasion, a student pointed out that (2) is really grammatical since it allows an interpretation in which 'have' is a main verb meaning 'get' and 'smoked pot' is a noun phrase with a structure similar to 'fried eggs.' Such interventions are usually greeted with the sort of groans that are the accepted form of expressing appreciation of puns, and they provide the same sort of comic relief that puns do in the midst of what is at times a boring enterprise.

Response on Everyblock to post by a person thinking of moving to Hyde Park: You should avoid the areas anywhere around the University, they may be unsafe -- people (even students) tend to get robbed and even murdered over there. Lots of University students get drunk and rowdy at the Woodlawn Tap on the weekends, so avoid 55th and Woodlawn. The University students are notorious for stealing bikes, laptops, and iPads -- so don't go anywhere near the University. However, you definitely want to venture out to 53rd street where you'll find a great deal of businesses, mostly dining in nature. Anywhere north of 55th and you're guaranteed to be immersed in a wide array of beautiful cultures - reflective of what Hyde Park has been for a long time. If you're not used to this landscape, then perhaps Hyde Park isn't for you.

When I go to the knife receptacle in South Campus Dining Hall, I expect to find a CLEAN KNIFE. Instead, I reached in and found this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMdJOb6fBoo&feature=kp. In case you've never used utensils before, let me spell it out for you: That is NOT a clean knife. It is a ragtime song being played on the piano. I’m no expert, but I’m pretty sure a knife is supposed to have a handle, a serrated edge, and NOT have a two four time signature. To make matters worse, this was the last “knife” left in the receptacle. So to everyone who thinks I'm complaining over nothing: YES, I did try to “just use it anyway.” That did not work! “Felicity Rag” did not cut my food at all, and I had to wait for a staff member to bring out new clean knives. Do you think that we pay $60,000 a year to cut our food with a song that was published in 1912?! It was originally composed ten years BEFORE THAT, but publisher John Stark wanted to stagger the release of Joplin's pieces. If you guys are fine with this, by all means keep eating there. I will be boycotting South Dining Hall until they make sure that ALL their knives are properly washed and I find a receptacle containing CLEAN SILVERWARE. NOT an underrated gem by “The King of Ragtime,” Scott Joplin. (I would just go eat in Bartlett, but anyone who’s tried that knows how long it takes to get a cup that doesn’t have a Samuel Beckett play stuck to the rim.)

Overseen in the Chicago Maroon comments: #TooReal Elly, if you really value open communication and dialogue as much as you claim, why have you *not responded* to the 1100 community members who presented our petition to you two weeks ago? Why have you ignored us, not even giving simple yes or no answers to the clear demands this petition articulated — demands that represent the considered perspectives of those who are most invested in preserving what made Summer Links such an “excellent program”? The petition, for reference: http://www.thepetitionsite.com/773/380/023/save-summer-links/ If this were truly a dialogue, you would give us the courtesy of listening and responding to our arguments, instead of offering vague palliatives about making the program “richer.” 1000 people have showed you that they believe these changes will gut the essential aspects that made Summer Links so strong. Simply saying these changes will strengthen the program does not make it so.

Dear UChicago, I have a huge project that I am trying to bring to campus this spring and I'm going to need your help and advice to try and make it the best that it can be. I want one week in spring quarter devoted to Identity at UChicago! Y'all have so many dope stories, perspectives, and experiences that I feel need to be concentrated in a time and space that really allows people to get a glimpse into what identity means for us on campus. I want anyone interested to comment or contact me with ideas, suggestions, criticisms, etc. I want to reflect YOUR experiences and I want to do it adequately and comprehensively. Thanks in advance for your attention and I hope you plan to help me along this journey. My Vision: A visual display on the Quad that will feature stories from the student campus that captures what different aspects of identity mean for us. Plenty of free swag and tables for RSOs and Groups to answer any and all questions about what part of identity they represent. Performances: Anything that involves identity will be given a platform. Finally, there will be A Website that will document any stories that do not involve some sense of visual or performance aspect. This will involve a feed that constantly cycles through stories of what it's like to be here so that anyone and everyone can access this material. #IdentityWeek #UChicago #TellYourStory #OurCampus

Eventually, [he] found a way to escape the bedroom: He matriculated at the University of Chicago. I feel like there are multiple implications this quote could have for the student body: -escape the bedroom.. and go to the library? -escape the pressure possibly present at other universities to engage in sexual activities, as represented by the bedroom? -escape some Freudian psyche bedroom and engage instead in some of the university's well-known S&M? -??? -this is just the weirdest out-of-context quote also, yeah, i used snapchat to keep it nameless b/c idk how to internet
When I graduated back in 2009, I thought I had escaped the….uncommon charm of UChicago once and for all. But here I am in law school halfway across the country, and someone in my class last week said something that totally reminded my of a that kid.

Seen on the internet: Residents in Hyde Park have reported a strange trembling in the neighborhood that started as the weather grew colder. ...When you put your head down on the floor, you can hear it welling up from below, Miller said of the sound, which he said usually occurs about once a day in the evenings. Miller said he wonders if his former employer, the University of Chicago, may have something to do with the phenomenon. ...Miller said during his time at the university from 1975 to 2000, he discovered passages in subbasements of university buildings that were off limits to faculty and staff. There are a lot of things going on under there, Miller said. If it's a secret, who would know? ...Will Vaughan, a graduate student at Brown University, spent his undergraduate years exploring Hyde Park's steam tunnels, where temperatures can rise to 120 degrees. Vaughan has found tunnels connecting many of the buildings on campus, but said he has not found anything in the area where people are reporting strange noises. Uhmmm.....

Overseen in Hyde Park and surrounding neighborhoods: Homelessness and bitter cold. If you come across a homeless person(s) out in the elements please direct them to the nearest warming shelter or help them onto CTA if they are unwilling to enter a shelter (a situation I've come across numerous times during canvassing and in the City). The call you make or the $2.25 you spend could save someone's life tomorrow. Call 311 to find warming shelter or look at the link posted below.

Overseeen: UChicago follows Cards Against Humanity on Twitter.
My first exposure to Paul Sally Jr. came the summer after my sophomore year in high school. My mom had made me enroll in the YSP camp at UChicago, and I sat in a classroom in Eckhart, eyes widening as Professor Sally hobbled in and proceeded to scare the living shit out high schoolers (me). The course he would be teaching was essentially part of the 160s sequence in 8 weeks, and as a high schooler who hadn't even taken calculus yet, I was FUCKING SCARED AS SHIT. And of course, he comes in, and with his booming voice, asks us to assign ourselves a coordinate so that he could just call out a coordinate whenever he wanted to call on a clueless kid like myself. Of course, though he had bad eyesight then as well, he manages to somehow pick me out from the crowd and asks me to assign myself a coordinate. I was in high school so I'm sure my voice sounded like I was inhaling helium, so I must have sounded hilarious as I trembled and blurted out, what's the point of origin?? To my horror, my last ditch response ended up pleasing him, and he said I like that answer. Of course, this meant he would call on me more during class. I lived in perpetual terror the rest of the summer, and swore that when it came time to apply for colleges, if all professors were like Sally, I didn't want to be a part of it. I must have secretly loved it though. I came here anyways, and even though I never had a class with him again, it's one of my favorite memories of this school. RIP

Fire drill... Part 2
So I made a list of demonyms for every residence hall on campus…which of course begs the question, why? Why would a man choose to engage in as pointless an activity as compiling such a list, and then expose himself to ridicule and disapproval by publishing it, knowing that many will not find the names to their liking and will probably be especially bewildered and outraged at the one assigned to their own house? Did he hope to derive some enjoyment from such a mindless activity? The answer, dear reader, is much simpler than that. I merely wished to remind you that I now have so, so little work to do, so much less than you, that, to the best of my imagination, this is the most excellent use to which I can put my time. (Also, I might have made this list in my head yesterday when I was supposed to be studying for an ancient Greek final, wondering why the noun declensions just weren’t sinking in. So it was just a matter of typing it out in a couple minutes and writing this lovely message just for you. You are more than welcome.)

Duke buddy of mine, It's crazy how right Marx was about aspects of life under Capitalism. College students studying for finals are like estranged laborers. They are alienated from the products of their labor, which in this cases consists of tests and papers. I feel like students, for the most part, don't feel the impact or gain the intelligence of studying 20 hours for one final because the final isn't designed to give back to you the amount of hours you put into it. It is just designed to assess your ability to think in a certain way when actually exploring the subject matter in a free way that would allow for much more education. Students also become alienated from themselves. They literally go to a library where you sit two feet away from someone else, sleep around 4 hours daily, ingest massive amounts of coffee, Red-Bull, and Aderall, and just turn into zombies staring at textbooks or laptop screens for 12 hours straight. People have to hand out food to remind kids they need to eat and that their bodies require maintenance. I can't think of any other aspect of normal life that requires you to do that to be productive or succeed. Maybe this is just my experience and outlook on finals week and I don't know or care to think about an alternative system, but just saw some interesting parallels.

Overseen on New Republic. Professor Jerry Coyne calls Deepak Chopra out on his pseudo-scientific bullshit. And yes, he’s a pseudoscientist, showing all the characteristics of that genre, including the use of meaningless jargon that sounds profound, a refusal to discuss serious criticism of his views, and a deep sense of persecution by “the establishment.” Photons do not have consciousness, nature does not have a mind, the moon is there whether humans see it or not, and intelligence is not inherent in nature, but a product of naturalistic evolution. As for chickens, bananas, and consciousness as a driver of evolution, I have no idea what Chopra is trying to say—and I’m an evolutionary biologist. http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115600/deepak-chopra-responds-pseudoscience-allegations

The sense of liberation I had at the University of Chicago was exhilarating. I felt very quickly that I could not go back to the old life, and I never did.

His powers of post-modernism far exceeded our novitiate attempts at ancient sorcery to bring him to the class. Although, since he was notorious for feeding upon the flesh of the living, perhaps it was for the best that we never succeeded.

UChicago Although lesser known than its peer institutions like Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, and Yale, the University of Chicago is a place so nerdy and intellectually stimulating that it leaves you feeling like you've been beaten over the head by Aristotle while the dead hands of Milton Friedman shove an economics textbook down your throat. First years walk in as brainy little dorks and graduate as big burly scholarly men. AT THIS SCHOOL, YOU WILL LEARN WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. Albert: Hey, Bart! We're going to a frat party tonight. Want to join? Bart: Nah, thanks for asking but I have to work on this problem set for complex analysis. Albert: Oh man, that's so UChicago of you.

Just an FYI for you folks, It's not actually possible for Freenters to determine whether or not the salted hashes of your passwords were compromised. There's no communication back to Freenters if and when someone finally gets a hash (via random generation) that is the exact same as the one listed next to your username. So you should in fact change your password if you used Freenters and didn't check their security first. Like me :(

To the UChicago Electronic Army what you did was extremely sad. I just want to say this: anyone who knew anything about computers could tell how obvious that their systems were unsecure. Did you forget that last year they simply had computers sitting out in the open without ANY sort of password verification? But if your friend offered to let your print whatever you needed to be printed on their personal system, would you say Oh, look! It's insecure! Let me teach them a lesson for giving me their trust! Yup - that's what it really is. You've demonstrated exactly what kind of people you are. Instead of seeing a problem and working together to make it better (yunno, one of the few UChicago startups that for a change is having a direct impact on the 99%), you exploit it - I imagine simply for ego and to send everyone a message. You're the kid who sees their friend's sandcastle falling apart and, rather than helping to fix it, smashes the whole fucking sandcastle. Anyways, good job. Oh wait - even you said yourself it was easy. So you didn't even manage to prove your skillz. You're just pathetic. As everyone here has been saying this is why we can't have nice things

Who else got the Freenters email?
Hello everyone! Here's a quick and easy guide for what to do if your Freenters account was hacked: http://bit.ly/dont-panic-about-freenters-public
Freenters was hacked. The hackers made public a string of information for each user that contains your password. It would take time to convert the string of information into login names and passwords. To be on the safe side, however, if you used this password on any other websites, you should go and change your password on those websites. Hitchhikers guide to the Freenters hack: http://bit.ly/dont-panic-about-freenters-public Please share this post with anyone who might have been affected. Be safe out there.
Freenters PR email says passwords were not compromised. Isn't this a lie? Weakly secured strings made available to the public qualifies as compromised, if you ask me.

Don't even care that this isn't overheard. Just trying to help a friend, and I know more people read this page than the class pages. Okay, computer science people, I have an emergency. My friend was doing her homework for 6 hours on racket and was nearly done when suddenly racket started acting funky. It told her it was out of memory, and it was being slow and weird, and so finally she just saved it and quit. This was not the first time she had saved the project - she had actually saved it many times while working on it. However, when she opened racket again and attempted to find it, it had completely disappeared. She has searched her entire computer and it's nowhere to be seen. The only proof that it ever existed is from a bat-type file that is labeled the same thing her file was labeled as. Except you can't open this file at all. HELP.

Over-read in The Onion. (Likely repost, as it's from 2007, but whatever.) (And yes, Michael Foote is the actual chair of the Dept. of Geophysical Sciences) _________________________________________________ Scientists Theorize What Would Happen If They Touched A Cloud CHICAGO—A group of scientists from the University of Chicago raised new questions during an international nephology conference held there Tuesday, speculating what would happen if physical contact were initiated with a cloud, the weather phenomenon described as a visible mass of condensed water suspended in the troposphere.

While Foote claimed that a person would likely attain instantaneous unconsciousness if laid horizontally atop a cumulus cloud, opposing scientists argued that a person would fall right through

All right guys, it's time for a really, really weird Overseen, on Facebook. So I was looking through old wall photos that I'd posted years back. I found one that I had posted in 2010 or 2011, LONG before I ever knew of UChicago's existence of a person with a humorous long Facebook name with middle names like Saluteme'orshootme, YoungFlockaCheckthewrist and Caintcountmyfelonies. I believe I posted this photo thinking the person in the photo was putting that as their name un-ironically. I looked at the photo and realized that it was a photo of our beloved Jose Medina's Facebook circa 2011. The actual photo is below. I have absolutely no idea how I ever found my way to his Facebook, but I did, long before I ever encountered Jose the University of Chicago. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150287152471033&set=a.170296131032.119893.740686032&type=3&theater That is a link to the photo.

I know down at UChicago they use IVs to streamline the feeding process, but we're still in the age of cafeterias and solid food. - Prof: You're wearing a different shirt than last meeting. I didn't realize UChicago students had time for a wardrobe and laundry. - Prof: It's not just that you guys are nerds, it's that you're super serious about everything, including your nerdiness. - Prof: I heard they got rid of a UChicago president because he was turning it into Northwestern. That's pretty bad when the greatest insult is comparing you to the second best college in the state. - Prof: Are there any big differences between the campus cultures? Me: Well, I walked around with wet hair and everyone looked at me like I had a bug on my face. I just didn't have time to blow-dry it this morning. And then I took a nap in the library and several people were concerned. That doesn't really happen at UChicago. Prof: Damn social and bodily processes. No one has time for that, there's studying to do! - Prof: Do you have any activities planned this week? Me: On Thursday night there's a... board game night. Prof: That hesitation. Perfect. Who has time for board games? - Prof: Are they organizing activities for all the interns to interact? Me: There's an ice cream social next week. Prof: You know what that is, right? UChicago hasn't taken away the wonders of ice cream and socializing? Me: I'm pretty sure UChicago has driven me to eat more ice cream than I ever would have.

In a place where defending and attacking ideas was honored more than analyzing them, those who could talk the longest and the loudest succeeded.

Further, according to by-laws In the event of a vacancy... the assembly shall choose a student to fill the vacancy - where is that student? • Thus, this means that a 5-person committee with one chair can decide all proceedings, penalties, warnings, disqualifications, and potentially the outcome of an election as long as a majority (not unanimous) vote occurs • 5/6 of the members are either currently in or were in SG last year, signaling a potential for bias give that SG is a small tight knit community • The selection process was not made public to the student body, and anyone who agreed to serve was placed on the committee. In other words, there was no student input on who sits on the committee and no checks were given to ensure no conflicts of interest • Up until the elections were pushed back, the committee was entirely student run, and the committee’s advisor didn’t attend meetings, wasn’t included in discussion, email threads, etc. The complaint about Ignite regarding early campaigning and creating positions • The database says the complaint was received 4/4 at 5:00PM. • 10+ days later when the Maroon Article was published, E&R said they had “addressed the second complaint but has not released the verdict.” Yet, to this day not a single one of the witnesses presented had been contacted by E&R. • Generally, the first several weeks of campaigning there was no opportunity for candidates to speak in front of all E&R members at once, but rather most of the communication was handled by one person, the E&R chair Lester Ang. There is a questionable transformation of wording when language is brought from the complaintant’s mouth through Lester to the E&R committee • In the article it says “E&R suggested Al-Jarani’s actions were unethical, but yet the deliberation and decision about an issue as large as this was made without any contact with the affected individuals? • In the complaint database for the major penalty against uchicaGOLD for the initial 10% vote deduction, one of the main accusations by the E&R committee towards uchicaGOLD was “leaking information still under investigation by E&R.” Yet, the E&R’s response to the article seemingly contradicts that anything was still under investigation because it says the committee had “addressed the second complaint.” Either way, if they were still addressing the complaint, why is it that no one had been contacted about the complaint? Creation of an illegal appeals committee to listen to “penalties given” • The SG Constitution Article IV.10 says “The Assembly shall have the power, on its own or through delegation or consent of the Elections and Rules Committee, to establish all rules and procedures for all elections. • Based on the pressure placed on E&R from many third party individuals. E&R decided to create an illegal appeals committee. • This new appeals committee was created without the consent of any SG members other than SG members besides SG President Renard Miller (who ran with and serves on slate with Ignite Candidate Yusef Al-Jarani) and Lester Ang, the chair of the E&R committee. • The Constitution was violated, and there is evidence that only a few days after the appeals committee convened one of the 2 “new” appeals committee members were openly endorsing Ignite slate on Facebook • It seems like there is a bit of bias present in this situation E&R members themselves reporting complaints against uchicaGOLD slate • Right after a complaint was filed by a constituent saying “Complaint that Yusef Al-Jarani was inviting people to the Vote for Tyler Kissinger for Community and Government Liaison Facebook event,” an E&R member said “Complaint that Steph Mui was inviting people to the Vote for Holly Rapp and Christina Dong for CGL and BOT Facebook event.” • Article IV of the Assembly Bylaws says, “Upon acceptance of their positions, all members of E&R shall sign commitments of neutrality in the elections” and “E&R members shall excuse themselves from deliberating in any campaign-related cases where such deliberation would create a conflict of interest” • Based on the minutes this is what a discussion between the E&R members involved. AKA [Redacted] is an actual E&R member [Redacted] claims that many of the endorsements for UChicaGOLD, especially for Steph Mui, are invalid. This is based on the idea that the people who chose to endorse UChicaGOLD were not made adequately aware of what endorsing a candidate entailed. [Redacted] also claims that if the students truly understood what exactly they were endorsing, they would instead have chosen to endorse [Redacted]. Major Infraction penalties being assigned to uchicaGOLD slate without following the correct process • SG Constitution Article 1, clauses 6: The Student Government may not set any procedural guidelines nor engage in any act which deprives students or Recognized Student Organizations of their fundamental right to be notified of proceedings against them, to speak in their defense if they so choose. • SG Candidates Packet: Two things must happen before a verdict results. “If a complaint is filed against you, you will receive an e-mail form the E&R chair with an anonymous, “sterilized” version of the complaint body.” Also, “You have 24 hours to respond to the complaint so that E&R may consider it at its next meeting.” • The process was not followed to reach the verdict of a 10% vote penalty, and when questioned, individual E&R members didn’t know why this happened (the same post as before, but this time with 100% more readability) - Brandon Callender

Overseen on Course Evaluations—a student's review of a Euro Civ TA: Ms. Kristy was very friendly and easily accessible both in-person and by email. She was a great help on my papers and taught me the word milieu. That said, I cannot get rid of the suspicion that she is a closet Putinist and wants to take over Russia. There is just something about her need to comment positively on democratic reforms in Russia (as if to say, Hey! I`m definitely not a Putinist) and the fact that she is writing a book about money that just makes you wonder. I guess it`s not all bad, because I think she would do a great job ruling the Motherland. She studies the Soviet Union, so she`d probably bring some positive reforms to the Russian sporting programs. I think we`d all benefit from some time in a sports barrack in Vladivostok. If you love democracy, she might not be the right T.A. for you. Also, she never told us how to properly address her, so we all called her Ms. Kristy. It sounds very antiquated and very British.

I've lived among you, studying your bizarre antics and frankly sub-par moral and hygienic standards and from what I've gleaned it seems that some of you consider yourselves the Randian heroes of your own college experiences; self-interested, independent to a fault - society be damned. Now, I'm not going to get into any philosophical arguments about the ethics of objectivism, mostly because that's not something I could do with any semblance of the academic rigor that being a uChicago student requires of me, but also because this is real life and no one gives two shakes about methodic doubt and dialectics. There is one thing that can safely be said about those people who give in to self interest: They're jerks. Don't be a jerk

That's what I think and I've never been wrong. You have a very important organ inside your brain: the brain. LECA went through a hippie phase that involved a lot of inhalation. I call this lecture 'Cute Things to Say and Learn About Prokaryotes.' If you ask a prokaryote, HGT is better than sex. …existential microbiological anguish. She had the biggest, most beautiful tonsils of any undergraduate. They burn the infidels with mitochondrial fire. If I were to tell you the story of my life you would be crying. I need a volunteer to be hit. Then we will all observe the effects and talk about your feelings. This is my own personal opinion, which should also be yours at least until the quarter is over. The monocytes are better dressed than the neutrophil. You don't know what this means but in thirty minutes you will. If in thirty minutes you don't, you'll be dead in thirty-five. It is released by these molecular scissors and then it goes Pingo. It's written in purple for a reason, because it brings death to the cell. You've heard of the DaVinci Code? The DaVinci Code was inspired by the ubiquitin code. This is one of the biggest discoveries in cell biology in the last ten years. They found an amino acid at the entrance of a proteasome and when they decoded it it said, 'Abandon all hope ye who enter here.' How does the ubitquitinated protein know it needs to go to the proteasome? There is a chaperone that holds its hand and says, 'Come dear, I'm going to axe you now.' A shirtless guy walks into the room, plays Careless Whisper on a saxophone and leaves. 10 free points to anyone who tells me that man's name. He will not graduate.

Overseen on the Quad
Overseen, a guy on the science quad walks up to a steam vent, which is releasing unrelenting white vapor. He stares at the vent for approximately 10 minutes, unmoving. Then he promptly walks away. Only to return about a minute later with what appears to be a rock, or ice block, and kicks it onto the vent, watching it melt. For about 10 more minutes. 10th week everybody, 10th week.

A bunch of us took Theories of Modern Violence this winter. Then we flooded Overheard with it, since the professor (Bernard Silberman) says a lot of pretty great stuff. So I thought I'd compile most of his quotes into one doc and throw it up here. If you ever had any doubts about taking one of his classes, here ya go. --- On not being able to hear a student: I'm coming up here to intimidate you. Professor: What do you call it when a bunch of people overthrow the government? Student: I'd call it chaos. Professor: Everybody else would call it a revolution. Prof: Why do we call it guerrilla warfare? Student: Because they're no better than animals. It's too warm in here. *Takes off coat* Don't get excited. I'm not doing a striptease. Talk slower! Do any of you watch soaps? Do you know why they talk so slowly? So they don't have to write as many words. (Silberman repeated the joke twice over the course of the quarter, each time forgetting that he already told it. Speaking of which:) I got my degree in history. Big mistake. In history you have to have a good memory. So I switched to PoliSci. What is a myth? And no, it's not a lisp for miss. *Winks* ...That was a joke. On walking into a nearly-empty class: The class is so small today. Must be Sorel. When the same thing happened next class: This happens every year. Why does it happen every year? And again: Where is everyone? Is everyone in bed? Why aren't you guys in bed? What's wrong with you people? Everybody owns North Face jackets! So weird! And shirts, and shoes, and underwear! Do they make stoves? Nobody better suggest that to them. At the end of the rant: Forget the reading. Your assignment for next class is to find out why everybody loves North Face. Did you know there are aliens walking around campus? No gloves, open jackets. Gotta be aliens. Prof: Are you going to take my word on it? What if I'm making it all up as I go along? Student: Does it matter? Prof: No. Political Scientists only care about arguments, not facts. We can make up whatever facts we want. Sorel is the kind of guy who sits on the quad and smokes cannabis. Does anybody wanna talk about Trotsky? Nobody? Okay, I'll call on you at random. You there! *Student cowers* Pick someone for me. *Student points wildly* You! I'M SORRY! On yet another nearly-empty class: TA: It's already 1:31. Prof: Okay, let's wait till 2. Prof: Science is accurate. Student: What about polticial science? Prof: That's not science. Or political. Is that profound? Of course it is. I said so. Man, even my TAs have stopped coming. Prof: Other countries have a well-defined canon. Student: I'm skeptical. Prof: You're welcome to be skeptical. But I'm right. On having to move to the back of the class to hear a student: You’re going to drive me to the goddamn grave. I’m going to have a heart attack. NOBODY cares about Jordan. *Student tries to leave* Prof: Had enough?! Student: No, I just have to leave. Prof: Oh, that's okay. ...I'll just cry. (followed by) Only a few people here actually talk to me, so when one leaves, it makes me sad. (Start of class) Prof: Did any of you read Rosen? *nobody raises hand* Prof: Seriously, nobody did the Rosen reading? Student: ...Actually, the reading was Hitler. Prof: Oh, how about that. Did anybody do THAT reading? *nobody raises hand* Are there any anthropologists here in this class? No? Good. I can insult them. I wake up at 4 AM to jog and lift weights. That's why I'm going to live forever and you're going to die young. (Silberman is pushing 80.) What you mean what do you mean what do I mean? There are no Nazis without Hegel. I didn't want to get into an existential discussion about heroin! You might think of addicts as entrepeneurs. They're searching for capital. The goal of an addict is to acquire more capital to acquire more heroin. Student: We're all driven by hormones! Prof: I don't know about you. Not me. On the last day: This is the most I've seen in weeks! Are you sure you're in the right classroom? Have one variable, people think you're a conspiracy theorist. Have two and they think you're a scientist. Let's make a four-cell table. Can't be a social scientist without em! *After drawing the frame* What do I put in here again? (On having a new idea) C'mon guys, prove me wrong. If you don't talk me out of it I'm gonna have to believe it! (Nobody can, and he's forced to agree with himself.)

We believe this opportunity offers you the chance to: Overview Campus Ambassadors will serve as the lead ￼ representatives on their college campuses. They will be responsible for spreading the word across campus through marketing, word of mouth, and a variety of other channels. They will report directly to the founders. Your Responsibilities: What We’re Looking For: ￼￼￼ Make the go‐to method to find a roommate after graduation Lead your campus marketing effort See the inner workings of a cool start‐up Brainstorm (and think creatively) about ways in which to optimize exposure on your campus Communicate the company’s value proposition and vision to your fellow students Report activities and successes to the founders Learn and grow with as our presence expands ￼￼￼ Someone who is razor sharp, creative, and eager to take initiative A fresh perspective and entrepreneurial spirit Eagerness to work at the front lines of a new start‐up A “no task is too small” attitude Terrific people skills Desire to design an amazing marketing campaign Killer organizational abilities and attention to detail Positive attitude, good energy and natural curiosity General awesomeness (https://docs.google.com/a/uchicago.edu/forms/d/1hiSuL82QG-TGMIMSMSmvUCoNQEODgC4c4b1AC5UuhcA/viewform?sid=4eed3fdb0ed6c123&token=wRGf7jwBAAA.DDkvA4qlOi6nHQGcgNBYeA.dmgPKu-EEoNt1Xh47tXX0A)

Pierce lore from dnainfo.com “Shortly after Pierce’s death, his lawyers found a series of numbers among his papers which they rightly guessed to be the combination to a safe in the shed behind the home. It was opened and inside was a note saying that the money was buried in the backyard. Some vague directions led the hunters to dig under a pear tree where they found $20,000 in gold coins and another note. In time more than $200,000 in antique gold coins was found buried; this and more conventionally deposited assets brought the Pierce bequest to about a million dollars,” Pridmore wrote.

On, on, you noblest policy analysts, Whose blood is fet from policy-brief-proofs!

Based on the fact that my email was censored from the UChicago List-Host, I have decided to post the list to Facebook and forward the email to the Maroon, the Chicago Tribune, the Sun-Times, and the Daily Herald. Please help the residents of Pierce rectify the current state of affairs in our dorm! To Whom It Apparently Does Not Concern, Based on the fact that my first email was censored by the moderator of the Pierce List-Host, I have now copied the Maroon, the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago Sun, and the Daily-Herald on this email. The showers just began working again after not functioning for almost 24 hours. The exploding toilets (cleverly nicknamed by fellow Pierce Residents The Pierce Geysers), however, have been quelled for the time being. Living in Pierce for this academic year has been nothing short of cruel and unusual punishment. Not only are all first years required to live on campus at an expense of close to $1,000 per month (including being forced to take the unlimited meal plan), but we are also extorted into paying this exorbitant fee to live in a hell hole that quite frankly is not fit for human life. There is constant creaking in the heating units that concern residents that they may malfunction, the elevators open about 6 inches above or below the floor they stop on, continuing to move until they reach the floor with the door open, the toilets shoot water and human excrement at whoever flushes them at least every other month (often times more frequently), the showers only work when they decide to, the water often malfunctions to the tune of brown water coming out of faucets and showers, and when that doesn't happen the tap water comes out a milky color and very bubbly on higher floors. Quite frankly, I feel as if I live in a building controlled by a slum lord, not a world class university. It is embarrassing to describe the state of affairs in this dorm, and while I am aware that the building is old, there is no excuse for a critical plumbing part to only have been installed over 30 years after Pierce was completed. While my anecdotes alone do not make a damning case against the state of this building, the anecdotes of over 100 people combined create a pattern. If conditions do not improve and response time to these problems does not quicken, I can assure you the proper legal course of action will be taken as the state of affairs in this dorm is nothing short of appalling. If you disagree, please refer to http://savepierce.tumblr.com/ for some photographic evidence. A few of the pictures have been attached to this email. Sincerely, A Concerned Pierce Resident

Hey, I overheard something about Overheard at UChicago! It's being moderated. No, not just by the existing facebook mechanisms that already prevent spam and abuse. But by a sole moderator who deems certain posts irrelevant. Everyone (all 3200+ of you) is at risk of having their membership and/or comments arbitrarily deleted by the moderator if they are deemed disruptive to the spirit of the group, e.g. if they go off on tangents about Pierce Housing on the thread regarding Pierce Living below, or try to have a serious discussion regarding the word raped in the post about the test just raped me, or anything else that is not strictly playful banter or one-liner quotes of Overheard phrases. After I got kicked off, I was told that If you want to come back, thats fine. You have to work within the spirit of the group. (I got back on when a friend was able to add me back onto the group.) Basically, if you go off on a tangent with your fellow UChicago students about anything meaningful besides the playful banter of overheard phrases, you'll probably get your comments deleted/your membership revoked. What do you guys think? Is this moderating really in the spirit of the group? Or not? Let's put this to the test.

I would like to thank Overheard at UChicago for their support of our cause to rectify the situation in Pierce.

CHDV 20405. Pornography and Language. 100 Units. The course explores the place and role of language in pornographic films. Why does language occur in filmed pornography at all? What kind of language occurs? What role does it play? How is it gendered? How does it frame the narrative or drive it forward? How does language subvert or undermine the visual representation of sex? What does any of this tell us about gender, sexuality and erotics in non-pornographic contexts? Course readings focus on theories of pornographic representation, theories of language, gender and erotics, and methods of transcribing and analyzing dialogue. The course requires students to watch a wide range of pornography, including different varieties of straight, gay and trans porn, so anyone enrolling in the course must be interested in pornography as a social and cultural phenomenon and must also have experience watching porn and thinking about it.

Hey guys, In my free time over the summer I wrote a web application to help UChicago students shop for textbooks. You enter your course schedule, then it generates a list of books needed for those classes and finds the lowest prices on the Internet for those books. This is the website: booksatuchicago.com Please spend a couple minutes and try it out. It should save you a lot of money compared to shopping at the UChicago Bookstore. Not 100% of UChicago courses are in the database yet, but classes are added automatically as professors add textbooks. I hope this makes your lives a little bit easier. - John-Reynold Lopez

Sosc TA evaluation: Mr. Grant is so hot it's hard to listen to him when he speaks, but when he opens that pretty mouth of his (which was all too rarely- I didn't hear him speak until fourth week or so), his lilting Irish vowels were like informative, helpful, nonjudgmental music to my silence-accustomed ears. Just to hear him talk about Aquinas' four types of laws was like listening to Orpheus himself sing his sweetest melody. He explained concepts so well that Miss Teen South Carolina could have written a dissertation after a week with the man. I did sometimes feel as though he was trying too hard to get us to arrive at a certain answer, which we weren't getting to, and then it would actually regress the discussion we were beginning by constantly going back to what he had meant exactly.

ECON 198 evaluation: I would require the completion of a one-question poll before entry to the class was permitted. The question: Are you a raging douche-bag? If answered yes, the student would not be allowed entry. Unfortunately, there were far too many raging douche-bags in this class for my taste, and their eradication (if violence is necessary, so be it) would surely be much appreciated by students in the future.

On teaching apes to talk with government funding (a la Dario Maestripieri): And they're going to go out into the wild and teach us all the secrets of mother nature... and we were going to send them out into space and if there was ever a problem with aliens, they would deal with them... they trained, for God's sake, dolphins to carry bombs in the ocean, of course they wanted to send monkeys on airplanes!

Evaluations Mk. 2: [instructor's name] does not seem to me to be a philosopher, she is what is known in Plato as a false philosopher; attracted by its many charms, but without the requisite skills, or disposition, or love of wisdom; she is what is known in Ethics as incontinent, she knows what is right, but cannot do it.
Reading the evaluations site can be worrying... The readings should change. Plato`s Republic is awful and Aquinas isn`t much better. Cicero was pretty sweet though, so we should read more of that.
If you do this, then you're making a strong metaphysical claim. But, this isn't the philosophy department, so we really don't have to worry about the broader implications. -Ling prof

Dear UChicago, Over the summer, in our free time, a friend and I wrote a web application to help students at UChicago shop for textbooks. You enter your course schedule, and then it generates a list of books needed for those classes and finds the lowest prices on the Internet for those books. This is the web app: http://booksatuchicago.com Please spend a couple minutes and try it out, and if you like it, let your friends know as well. It should save you a lot of money compared to shopping at the UChicago Bookstore. Also, not 100% of UChicago's books are in the database yet, but classes are added automatically as professors add textbooks to their syllabi. I hope this makes your lives a little bit easier this year. -JR
